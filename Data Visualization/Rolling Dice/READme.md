This is a guided project wherein I used python visualization package pygal to produce scalable vector graphics file. we’ll analyze the results of rolling dice. If you roll one 
regular six-sided die, you have an equal chance of rolling any of the numbers from 1 through 6. However, when using two dice, you’re more likely to 
roll certain numbers rather than others. We’ll try to determine which numbers are most likely to occur by generating a data set that represents rolling 
dice. Then we’ll plot the results of a large number of rolls to determine 
which results are more likely than others.
